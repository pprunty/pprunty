A novel approach to user content recommendation systems which opens a two-way communication channel (web-socket) between the user and
recommendation algorithm via a content filter configuration system on the frontend

TikTok, is notably leading this race in terms of recommendation. Their vertical scrolling mechanism is so addictive,
people have coined the term doomscrolling to refer to the feeling of impending doom, or anxiety associated with spending
an excessive amount of time scrolling through social media and contracting social media envy or a fear of missing out 
(F.O.M.O).

Additionally, companies like Instagram, YouTube and more recently, Amazon (through Amazon's Inspire, to be released
in …) have all jumped on the bandwagon and have included vertical scrolling as a feature in their product.

UI/UX Design and prototyping using Figma
Entity Relationship Diagrams
Web-socket development using Python FastAPI
iOS and Android mobile application development using React Native (with Redux)
Deep Learning neural networks using Python libraries such as Tensorflow 2, Keras, Surprise and Pandas
C++ interoperability using Boost.Python
Parallel programming using Python's standard library

I do not want to see spoilers, i want to control the content being recommended to me by the algorithm and let it naturally 
change, but always be configurable.
