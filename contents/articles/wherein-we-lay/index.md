_Poem by Patrick Prunty_

--- 

Wherein We Lay
A crocodile balloon in the heat forced us still.
We lay there, breathing
Dusk unto Dawn
Together - unable to move.
Afraid to break this altogether silence
Like two become one,
Like this love is fun,
Like dawn would never come.
In time, you are there with me still - unmoving
I wished then that tomorrow would never come.
But tomorrow becomes today
and -
today
becomes tomorrow
And were I with you still I would forget this - moving:
And together we could be each other's undoing
But then build ourselves up, and up.
