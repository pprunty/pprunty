Poem by Patrick Prunty

--- 

<p>Wherein we lay</p>

<p>A crocodile balloon in the heat forced us still</p>
<p>We lay there, breathing</p>
<p>Dusk unto dawn,</p>
<p>Together - unable to move</p>


<p>Afraid to break this altogether silence,</p>
<p>Like two become one,</p>
<p>Like this love is fun,</p>
<p>Like dawn would never come.</p>


<p>In time, you are there with me still - unmoving,</p>
<p>I wished then that tomorrow would never come.</p>
<p>But tomorrow becomes today,</p>
<p>and -</p>
<p>today becomes tomorrow.</p>

<p>And were I with you still, I would forget this - moving:</p>
<p>And together we could be each other's undoing,</p>
<p>But then build ourselves up, and up.</p>
