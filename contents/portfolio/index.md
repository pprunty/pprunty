## 🖥️ Software Projects:

* <a href="https://www.tcd.ie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">```shapeshifter```</a> - An 
open-source solution for building dynamic, multipage user interfaces interactively. shapeshifter leverages
the power of insert and command modes, reminiscent of the vi/vim editor, allowing you to manipulate web components 
directly on your local server. The project supports real-time updates, enabling you to add new components, 
adjust styling, and modify component hierarchy on-the-fly. The project includes a plugin and template library which 
allows you to plugin standardized and modularized components in your project, and build your project using a template.
