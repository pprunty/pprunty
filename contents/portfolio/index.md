My name is  <span style="color:#FF612B">Patrick Prunty</span> and I’m a Fullstack Software Engineer
at Optum Healthcare. Previously, I studied MSc in High-Performance Computing at Trinity College
Dublin, BA Mathematics and English Literature at University College Dublin, 
created a few open source projects and helped build SwiftKey for iOS.

I do triathlon, follow Chelsea Football Club, travel, and write on topics ranging from technology
to climate change, social justice, and human rights – and how they all interact.
