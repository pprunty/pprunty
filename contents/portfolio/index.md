My name is  <span style="color:#FF612B">Patrick Prunty</span> and I’m a Fullstack Software Engineer
at Optum Healthcare. Previously, I studied MSc. in High-Performance Computing at Trinity College
Dublin, B.A Joint Honours in Mathematics and English Literature at University College Dublin. I am currently working
on a couple of open source projects and the release of a mobile application to the iOS and Android 
app stores.

I do triathlon (swim, cycle and run), travel and follow Chelsea Football Club. I also write on a variety of topics 
ranging from science and technology to creative prose.

## 🖥️ Software Projects:


* <a href="https://github.com/pprunty/shapeshifter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">```shapeshifter```</a> is an open-source tool
for creating dynamic, multipage user interfaces interactively through the user interface itself. Inspired by vi/vim, 
it allows real-time manipulation of web components on your local server via shapeshifter 'edit mode'. The platform offers
a library of templates to build your project from, and modular components which can be plugged in to your project, for 
quick, standardized and interactive development.

```version 0.1.0 demo```: 🔜
