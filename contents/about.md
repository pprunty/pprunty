Footfalls echo in the memory

Down the passage which we did not take

Towards the door we never opened

Into the rose-garden. 

My words echo

Thus, in your mind.

But to what purpose?

Disturbing the dust on a bowl of rose-leaves

I do not know.

Other echoes inhabit the garden. 

Shall we follow?
